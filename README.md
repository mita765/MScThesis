# IMPORTANT --- If you want to run these notebooks (rather than look at the embedded outputs):
### Windows Users
Run `create_env_kernel.bat`
### Linux Users
Open your terminal in .../MScThesis and run the following script in terminal:
```
chmod +x create_env_kernel.sh && ./create_env_kernel.sh
```
This will install all the necessary libraries used in Thesis-TR and Thesis-ML.
## After running `create_env_kernel`:
Open the notebook you would like to run and select the `thesis` Jupyter kernel. Then, simply run all.
